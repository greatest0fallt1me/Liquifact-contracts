# Liquifact Escrow Typed Error Codes

LiquiFact escrow emits typed Soroban contract errors through `EscrowError`. Clients should branch
on the numeric `ContractError(code)` value, not on panic strings or diagnostic text.

## Stability Policy

Error codes are append-only. Once a code is assigned, it must not be renamed for a different
meaning, reused, or renumbered. New failures must receive new codes after the existing range.

Legacy panic messages are listed only to help integrators migrate old simulations and logs.

## Client Guidance

In tests and SDK simulations, `try_*` clients surface typed traps as contract errors. For example,
`FundingAmountNotPositive` is observable as `ContractError(100)` / `Error(Contract, #100)`.

Recommended SDK mappings:

| Codes | Suggested client category |
| --- | --- |
| 1-13 | Invalid initialization or pricing configuration |
| 20-22 | Missing initialized escrow metadata |
| 30-41 | Dust sweep or token integration failure |
| 50-62 | Attestation or collateral metadata failure |
| 70-80 | Administrative validation failure |
| 90-92 | Migration failure |
| 100-110 | Funding failure |
| 120-129 | Settlement, withdrawal, or investor payout failure |
| 140-143 | Cancellation or refund failure |

## Security Notes

- Auth boundaries from ADR-002 remain unchanged. Typed errors do not replace `require_auth`.
- Overflow-sensitive paths use checked arithmetic and map each overflow to a stable code.
- Dust sweep and refund transfers keep balance-delta checks at the external token boundary.
- Refund uses checks-effects-interactions by zeroing contribution before transfer to prevent
  double-spend. Investor payout remains idempotent after the claim marker is written.
- Storage TTL behavior is unchanged by the error migration; `bump_ttl` still extends contract
  instance storage and persistent allowlist entries.
